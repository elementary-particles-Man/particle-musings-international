        <h1>[Commentary Report]<br>Who Moves Japanese Politics?<br>The Ministry of Finance's Influence (Part 3)</h1>

        <h2>V. Can Politicians Resist?—Attempts at "Political Leadership" and Their Limits</h2>

        <h3>A. Efforts by Politicians—Those Who Seriously Tried to Change Things</h3>
        <p>As seen so far, if the Ministry of Finance and bureaucracy are powerful, one may wonder whether elected politicians have done nothing. In fact some politicians tried to overhaul the system or openly say <u>"no" to the ministry</u>.</p>
        <p>For example, some advocated <strong>expansionary fiscal policy</strong> to improve citizens' lives, harshly criticized dubious amakudari practices, or attempted to reclaim authority from bureaucrats. When the Prime Minister's Office took the lead across ministries, it was called <strong>cabinet-led politics</strong>, another form of resistance.</p>
        <p>During the Democratic Party administration (2009–2012), a project called <strong>"policy reviews"</strong> publicly scrutinized government programs and cut waste. This was one attempt to have politicians take the initiative and challenge the bureaucracy.</p>

        <h3>B. Why Is Resistance So Difficult?—Watered-Down Reforms and Politicians' Limits</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately many of these efforts were <u>watered down or ended without much success</u>. One reason is the tremendous information power of the bureaucracy—especially the Ministry of Finance—and its networks with the media and business world. The ministry can spread messages like "reforms will cause fiscal collapse" to stir anxiety, run negative campaigns through the media, or lobby other ruling-party members to blunt reform.</p>
        <p>Politicians themselves face limits. Even if they hold key posts, they often rotate after only a few years, making it <u>difficult to contend long term with expert bureaucrats</u>. They must also consider their constituents and party line, so bold reforms for the sake of the entire nation are not always possible.</p>
        <p>Sadly, some politicians may even be co-opted by the ministry and <u>lower the flag of reform</u>, or make statements in line with the ministry in hopes of future positions. Even the Prime Minister may find it nearly impossible to completely ignore the ministry. When one prime minister said Japan's economy might be worse than Greece's (which had defaulted), it was seen as <u>an endorsement of the ministry's long-standing "fiscal crisis" line</u> and caused a stir.</p>

        <h4>Summary of This Section</h4>
        <ul class="summary-list">
            <li>In the past some politicians and administrations challenged the ministry's approach, promoting expansionary policy or policy reviews.</li>
            <li>But these attempts were often obstructed or diluted by the bureaucracy's information power, networks, and media strategy.</li>
            <li>Politicians face constraints such as short terms, lack of expertise, elections, and party policies, making sustained confrontation difficult.</li>
            <li>Sometimes politicians are co-opted or make misguided statements, inadvertently reinforcing the ministry's stance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>VI. Looking at Specific Policies—How Odd Economic Policies Are Decided</h2>

        <h3>A. Is the Consumption Tax Really for Social Security?—The Story Behind the Hikes</h3>
        <p>The <strong>consumption tax</strong> is familiar because it applies to everyday purchases. For years the ministry has said <u>Japan's aging society requires raising this tax to fund pensions, healthcare, and nursing care</u>. Maintaining social security is indeed crucial.</p>
        <p>Yet there are doubts. Consumption tax is regressive, burdening low-income people more. Raising it during a slump chills consumer spending and worsens the economy. Past tax hikes are blamed for deepening deflation.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, from the viewpoint of the managed currency system, <u>social security need not rely solely on consumption tax</u>. The government can issue bonds—effectively new money—to fund it. The argument that without consumption tax social security will collapse may be a type of threat or propaganda to make people accept hikes. Some analyses even suggest part of the revenue has filled gaps left by corporate tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Whenever consumption tax increases are debated, the ministry is suspected of shaping public opinion for higher taxes and <u>guiding politicians</u> in that direction.</p>

        <h3>B. Why Did Abenomics Fall Short?—The Ministry's Resistance and the Shadow of Austerity</h3>
        <p>Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policy "<strong>Abenomics</strong>" announced three arrows, including bold monetary easing and flexible fiscal spending, aimed at escaping prolonged deflation.</p>
        <p>Yet Abenomics generally failed to achieve its goals. A key reason is that <u>the second arrow—fiscal spending—was repeatedly scaled down by the ministry's resistance</u>. The ministry traditionally adheres to <strong>fiscal balance</strong> (placing priority on balanced budgets). Thus even when large-scale spending was planned, it was curtailed on grounds of "no funding" or "more debt," and consumption tax hikes were pushed through before effects appeared. Many experts say the 2014 and 2019 hikes during Abenomics <u>broke the momentum of recovery</u> and delayed deflation's end.</p>
        <p>This suggests that even policies led by the Prime Minister's Office can have their effect greatly reduced if the ministry truly resists—an ironic demonstration of why it is called the "most powerful ministry."</p>

        <h3>C. Rate Hikes in Deflation? Austerity During COVID?—Policy Decisions Ignoring People's Lives</h3>
        <p>Some economic policies make us wonder "why do that?" Japan has long suffered from deflation, which calls for easier money. Yet the Bank of Japan has sometimes hinted at or implemented <strong>rate hikes</strong>, which could worsen deflation—an economically puzzling move. Observers suspect that the supposedly independent Bank of Japan may be deferring to the government's (effectively the ministry's) austerity line.</p>
        <p>During the unprecedented crisis of COVID-19, Japan's fiscal response was said to be smaller than that of other nations. While many citizens struggled, the ministry, citing <strong>fiscal discipline</strong>, seemed reluctant to act boldly. Prioritizing a mistaken fiscal view over people's lives disappointed many. When a vice minister published an article warning of looming fiscal collapse (the <strong>Yano article affair</strong>), it became a political issue—another sign of the ministry's insistence on austerity.</p>
        <p>These case studies suggest that the ministry's ideology of "fiscal balance" and "austerity" <u>distorts economic policy and harms citizens' lives</u>.</p>

        <h4>Summary of This Section</h4>
        <ul class="summary-list">
            <li>Arguments that consumption tax hikes are for social security face many questions: regressivity, economic harm, and the flexibility of funding under a managed currency system.</li>
            <li>Abenomics aimed for bold easing and spending, but ministry resistance, including pushing consumption tax hikes, limited its success.</li>
            <li>Proposals for rate hikes during deflation and insufficient fiscal response to crises show policies that seem to prioritize flawed fiscal discipline over people's lives.</li>
            <li>These examples imply the ministry's austerity ideology strongly shapes Japan's economic policy.</li>
        </ul>
