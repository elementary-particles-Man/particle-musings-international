        <h2>III. The Bureaucracy and the Ministry of Finance: Apparent Weakening and Subtle Control</h2>

        <h3>A. What Is the Bureaucrats' Real Power?—Expert Knowledge and Possible Information Control</h3>
        <p>Bureaucrats hold specialized knowledge and information essential for drafting laws and carrying out policy. When new legislation is prepared, bureaucrats often finalize the details and gather data. Most laws submitted to the Diet are <strong>Cabinet bills</strong> written by bureaucrats, showing that they influence policy from its inception.</p>
        <p>If that expertise and information are used not for the benefit of all citizens but to secure <strong>ministerial interests</strong> or to push a particular idea—such as the austerity view that higher taxes are unavoidable to reduce national debt—it becomes a <u>quiet threat</u> to democracy. When information is manipulated or unfavorable facts are hidden, citizens cannot make informed choices.</p>

        <h3>B. Has "Political Leadership" Really Taken Hold?—How "Sontaku" Emerges and Bureaucrats Resist</h3>
        <p>Since the 2000s, the phrase <strong>"political leadership"</strong> has often been used, meaning politicians elected by the people should take charge rather than leaving everything to bureaucrats. As part of this, the <strong>Cabinet Personnel Bureau</strong> was created so the Prime Minister's Office, not just ministries, manages senior officials' appointments.</p>
        <p>On the surface this seems to let politicians control bureaucrats. In reality, critics say bureaucrats read politicians' moods and become <u>excessively compliant, known as <strong>sontaku</strong></u>. If career advancement hinges on pleasing superiors rather than true ability, an organization can weaken.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile a powerful ministry like the Ministry of Finance can skillfully guide politicians and implement its agenda under the banner of "political leadership." Thus slogans alone may not change the <u>inherent influence</u> of the bureaucracy.</p>

        <h3>C. Did the Financial Services Agency Break Free from the Ministry?—Networks of Retirees and Unseen Influence</h3>
        <p>After the bubble economy burst, financial administration was separated from the Ministry of Finance and the new <strong>Financial Services Agency (FSA)</strong> was created in 2001. This was meant to disperse the ministry's excessive authority.</p>
        <p>Yet has the FSA truly become independent? Some note that senior FSA posts are still filled by former finance officials and retired bureaucrats continue to land jobs at financial institutions or related groups—so-called <strong>amakudari</strong>. Through these networks, the ministry may <u>retain indirect influence</u> over financial policy and supervision. If so, decisions may prioritize the ministry's wishes or industry convenience over the public interest.</p>
        <p>Finance Ministry alumni also take key posts in international organizations such as the IMF. While this can amplify Japan's voice globally, it also means <u>the ministry's thinking may shape international economic trends</u>.</p>

        <h4>Summary of This Section</h4>
        <ul class="summary-list">
            <li>Bureaucrats possess expertise and information that greatly influence policy, but this power can serve ministerial interests or ideology.</li>
            <li>Reforms aiming for "political leadership"—for example, the Cabinet Personnel Bureau—may simply lead to excessive sontaku or more subtle bureaucratic control.</li>
            <li>The FSA was separated from the ministry, yet personnel exchanges and alumni networks suggest the ministry still wields influence over financial administration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IV. The Ministry of Finance: The Reality of an "Absolute Authority"</h2>

        <h3>A. Three Major Powers of the Ministry—Budget, Taxation, and the "Invisible Pressure"</h3>
        <p>The Ministry of Finance is said to hold unmatched power among Japanese government institutions. Its power comes from three main sources: (1) <strong>budget compilation authority</strong>, controlling how the national budget is allocated; (2) <strong>tax system planning authority</strong>, shaping the tax structure; and (3) <strong>the authority to investigate national taxes</strong>, exercised through the National Tax Agency.</p>
        <p>The <strong>budget compilation authority</strong> lets the ministry craft the draft budget that determines how much money the government spends each year. Every ministry requests funds from the Ministry of Finance, which wields the assessment power to approve, reduce, or deny those requests—meaning it <u>controls the flow of money behind all government activities</u>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>tax system planning authority</strong> allows the ministry, particularly its Tax Bureau, to design new taxes like consumption tax or corporate tax and to propose rate changes. Because taxes provide the government's revenue base, deciding how to collect them profoundly affects the nation.</p>
        <p>The National Tax Agency's <strong>investigative authority</strong> examines whether taxes are properly paid and can impose additional taxes or file charges if fraud is found. Even the possibility of being investigated can exert <u>substantial pressure</u> on companies, individuals, and sometimes politicians or the media. Used improperly, it could intimidate those who oppose the ministry, threatening democracy itself. The mere existence of this authority is said to silence critics.</p>

        <h3>B. How the "Zaimu Sect" Is Formed—Information Strategies and the Trap of Austerity</h3>
        <p>The ministry's real power goes beyond legal authority. More insidious is its information strategy that implants in the public consciousness "common sense" beneficial to the ministry. The prime example is the <strong>fiscal-collapse narrative</strong> that warns "Japan will go bankrupt because of its debt."</p>
        <p>As noted earlier, under the managed currency system Japan issues its own yen. Therefore, yen-denominated government bonds cannot default in the usual sense. Yet repeated media reports—"Japan's debt is 1,200 trillion yen!" "Each citizen owes so many million yen!"—make people believe Japan is in dire straits. This fosters acceptance of <strong>austerity</strong> measures such as raising the consumption tax and cutting public services.</p>
        <p>This situation, in which the ministry's austerity line is accepted as absolute truth, is sometimes called the <strong>"Zaimu Sect"</strong>. Once this belief spreads, essential fiscal spending to escape deflation or promote growth is neglected, leading to prolonged stagnation. The notion that "tax cuts require other revenue sources"—often repeated by politicians and the media—shows how deeply this teaching has penetrated. Understanding the managed currency system reveals that <u>tax cuts do not necessarily need "other revenue sources"</u>; issuing government bonds can cover them.</p>

        <h3>C. Can the Media Oppose the Ministry?—"Freedom Not to Report" and Manipulation of Public Opinion</h3>
        <p>It may be naive to think the ministry merely influences the media. Some even say that <u>major outlets are effectively under the ministry's <strong>control</strong></u>. This is because media repeatedly run stories denying the managed currency system—"Japan will collapse under its debt!"—or criticizing budget bills for too much deficit financing without questioning these claims.</p>
        <p>If the media were truly neutral and reported diverse views, such one-sided coverage would be strange. Through the press-club system (where reporters are stationed at ministries), informal meetings with executives, and ultimately <u>tax investigations of media companies or adjustment of advertising</u>, the ministry allegedly steers coverage to suit itself while keeping critical opinions off the air—an exercise of the so-called <strong>"freedom not to report"</strong>.</p>

        <h3>D. Influence Reaching the World?—Exporting Austerity via the IMF</h3>
        <p>The ministry's influence may extend beyond Japan. It sends many officials to international financial bodies like the IMF and World Bank. While this boosts Japan's voice, some view it as a channel to <u>spread the ministry's austerity-first "Japan model"</u> to other countries through these organizations. If true, it could hinder global growth and widen international disparities.</p>

            <li>Major media may be strongly influenced by the ministry, leading to suspicions of "media control" that suppress unfavorable information.</li>
            <li>The ministry may also promote austerity worldwide through international bodies like the IMF.</li>
