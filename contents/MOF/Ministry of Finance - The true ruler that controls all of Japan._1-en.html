        <h1>[Commentary Report]<br>Who Moves Japanese Politics?<br>The Ministry of Finance's Influence</h1>

        <h2>I. Introduction: Questions Examined in This Report</h2>

        <h3>A. Wondering "Who Really Holds Power?"</h3>
        <p>In this report we ask together, "Who truly drives Japan's politics?" Is it the politicians elected in elections? Or is it the people as a whole? Some suggest that the bureaucracy—particularly the <span class="highlight-text"><strong>Ministry of Finance</strong></span>—wields tremendous power.</p>
        <p>Japan's money issuance is based on a <span class="highlight-text"><strong>managed currency system</strong></span> (a form of fiat currency system) in which the government and the Bank of Japan control the amount of money in circulation. Considering this structure, we will explore how the Ministry of Finance functions and influences policy, while reflecting on Japan's economic and social issues.</p>
        <p>You may have heard the phrase <span class="highlight-text"><strong>"Zaimu Sect"</strong></span>. It refers to the notion that the ministry's view—"government spending should be restrained" (known as <strong>austerity</strong>)—spreads among the public, politicians, and the media as if it were an unquestionable truth. But is that really the case? A country that issues its own currency—Japan issues the yen—cannot fundamentally go bankrupt because of debt in that currency. This report addresses the serious suspicion that the ministry might be hiding or distorting this key point, thereby warping public spending and keeping Japan's economy sluggish for decades.</p>

        <h3>B. Ideals in the Constitution vs. a Possible "Reality"</h3>
        <p>The Constitution of Japan clearly states that the ultimate authority in politics belongs to the people—this is <span class="highlight-text"><strong>popular sovereignty</strong></span>. Yet if the Ministry of Finance, through its strong authority and access to information, effectively steers major national decisions without properly reflecting the voices of the people or of elected Diet members, then this essential principle written in the Constitution may be no more than formality. "The solemn trust of the people" can become a hollow phrase if those in power fail to fully explain their actions.</p>

        <h3>C. Purpose and Approach of This Report</h3>
        <p>The goal of this report is to determine to what extent the Ministry of Finance behaves as an almost absolute power, ignoring or exploiting the managed currency system and imposing flawed economic ideas—such as cutting spending during a downturn or overly stoking alarm about national debt—on the public and politicians.</p>
        <p>To do so, we first compare the form of government defined by the Constitution with Japan's current "reality." Next we analyze how bureaucrats, especially the ministry, hold their power through mechanisms such as personnel control over other agencies like the Financial Services Agency, the placement of retired officials, influence over the media, and their authority over taxation investigations and budgeting. We then examine concrete examples—consumption tax issues, Abenomics, responses to COVID-19, and Bank of Japan policies—from the perspective of the managed currency system. Finally, we propose what is needed to improve Japan's democracy and economy.</p>

            <li>This report investigates whether the Ministry of Finance is Japan's true power holder, especially through the lens of the managed currency system.</li>
            <li>The Constitution proclaims popular sovereignty, yet the reality may depart from this ideal.</li>
            <li>We analyze the ministry's power structure and specific policies to reflect on Japan's democracy and economy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>II. The Constitution's Vision of the Nation and Our Sovereignty</h2>

        <h3>A. What Is the Constitution of Japan?—Basics of Popular Sovereignty and Parliamentary Democracy</h3>
        <p>The basic rulebook for Japanese politics is the <strong>Constitution of Japan</strong>. One of its core ideas is <span class="highlight-text"><strong>popular sovereignty</strong></span>, meaning the people ultimately decide the nation's course. The preamble declares, "We, the Japanese people... confirm that sovereign power resides with the people"—a proclamation that the public is the protagonist.</p>
        <p>The people's representatives gather in the <strong>Diet</strong>. Article 41 stipulates that it is "the highest organ of state power and the sole law-making organ." Through elections we choose Diet members, who debate and decide the country's rules. This is the essence of <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> (representative democracy).</p>
        <p>The <strong>Cabinet</strong>, headed by the Prime Minister, actually governs based on the laws and budget decided by the Diet. It is responsible to the Diet (Article 66) and directs the bureaucratic organizations—such as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs—to work for the people (Article 73).</p>
        <p>Figure 1 below illustrates how the Constitution envisions this ideal structure and how the people's sovereignty connects to politics.</p>

        <h3>B. Is "the People's Trust" Being Honored?—Ignoring the Managed Currency System and Lack of Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Constitution also states that "the authority of government is derived from the people, the powers are exercised by their representatives, and the benefits are enjoyed by the people." This means <u>politicians and bureaucrats are entrusted by the people</u>, and the results of their work (benefits) should be returned to the people.</p>
        <p>However, this report questions whether that trust is being shaken. Specifically, the <span class="highlight-text"><strong>managed currency system</strong></span> underpinning the nation's money may not be properly explained to the public—or may be intentionally ignored—when economic policies are decided.</p>
        <p>For example, have you heard phrases such as "<u>the national debt is overwhelming!</u>" or "<u>Japan will go bankrupt at this rate!</u>" or "<u>Don't leave the bill to future generations!</u>"? Such statements create anxiety, leading to conclusions like "therefore we must raise the consumption tax" or "therefore we must cut spending" (austerity). Yet a country like Japan, which issues its own currency, cannot <strong>in principle go bankrupt</strong> from debt denominated in that currency. If necessary, the Bank of Japan can supply money. (Of course, issuing unlimited money could lead to rapid inflation, but that is a separate issue from "bankruptcy.")</p>
        <p>Despite this, the "fiscal-collapse narrative" spreads and, once believed, prevents the spending needed to improve the economy—investments in education, science, or cash payments to citizens. Remarks by top leaders can spread such misconceptions as well. When one leader once suggested Japan's economy might be worse than debt-ridden Greece's, it drew criticism at home and abroad and damaged Japan's credibility. This shows that those entrusted with power may not be fulfilling their <u>responsibility to provide accurate explanations (accountability)</u>.</p>

        <h4>Summary of This Section</h4>
        <ul class="summary-list">
            <li>The Constitution rests on popular sovereignty: representatives elected by the people decide laws and budgets, and the Cabinet executes them.</li>
            <li>Politics should be based on the people's trust, yet misunderstanding of the managed currency system leads to the "fiscal-collapse" narrative distorting economic policy.</li>
            <li>Because Japan issues its own currency, its debt situation is fundamentally different from that of other nations, and outright "bankruptcy" is unlikely.</li>
            <li>Politicians and bureaucrats have a duty to explain facts to the public in an understandable way.</li>
        </ul>
