                This page introduces the Ministry of Finance of Japan and its powerful internal policy framework often referred to as the “Zaimu Shinrikyo” (Ministry Cult).<br>
                While efforts have been made to explain matters clearly, please note that the Ministry wields tremendous power.<br>
                Japan operates under a fiat currency system (管理通貨制度), but legal frameworks like the Fiscal Law and Ministry Establishment Act, as well as the government’s “primary balance surplus” policy, act contrary to this system.<br>
                These policies wrongly assume that taxes fund expenditures and that government bonds are debts to be repaid by taxes.<br>
                This section critically examines those policies and their constitutional, economic, and democratic implications.<br>
                Each article can be read independently, but we recommend reading them in order for a more systematic understanding.<br>
                ※ Diagrams and simple explanations are included for better comprehension of the real monetary structure.

                            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This multi-part report examines the vast influence of Japan’s Ministry of Finance—budget formation, taxation policy, audit authority, and media manipulation. Using the lens of the fiat system, it reveals how this influence distorts both economic policy and democracy itself.</p>
