      <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Born in 1981, Shinjiro Koizumi is the second son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
        He rose quickly within the LDP ranks, known more for his charisma than for legislative accomplishments.
        His tenure as Minister of the Environment (2019–2021) drew mixed reactions, particularly due to vague rhetoric
        and lack of concrete achievements.

      <h2>Public Perception</h2>
      <p>
        Often viewed as a "poster boy" politician, Koizumi's media presence has been substantial.
        However, critics argue that his policy positions are shallow and overly reliant on style over substance.
        Social media reactions tend to oscillate between idolization and satire.

      <h2>Controversies</h2>
      <p>
        During his term, Koizumi was criticized for ambiguous statements on climate policy and vague press conferences.
        One of his remarks — "I want to tackle climate change in a sexy way" — became symbolic of his often
        confusing communication style.

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        Koizumi remains a polarizing figure. Supporters see future potential, while detractors view him as
        emblematic of style-driven, low-substance politics in modern Japan.
        Whether he matures into a policy-maker or remains a media figure is yet to be seen.
