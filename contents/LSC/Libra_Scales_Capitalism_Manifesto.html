        <h1>Libra/Scales Capitalism Manifesto<br><span style="font-size: 16pt; color: #336699;">LSC: Libra/Scales Capitalism</span></h1>
        <p>Our society is currently facing a multitude of problems: widening disparities, anxiety about the future, and rising international tensions. When we delve into the roots of these issues, we seem to arrive at a single structural problem: the "imbalance of the scales" within our economic system.</p>
        <p>Originally, finance was intended to support and facilitate the real economy (people's lives and productive activities). Both were supposed to be interdependent, fostering the prosperity of society as a whole by maintaining balance. However, in modern times, finance has become an end in itself. In its excessive pursuit of short-term profits and numerical targets, it has left the real economy behind, distorting its healthy growth. Could it be that this severe imbalance of the <strong>"scales between finance and the real economy"</strong> is undermining not only economic stability but also the vitality and stability of society as a whole?</p>
        <p>The term "economy" originally held a broader meaning, referring to the governance of a nation and the relief of its people's suffering.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> It is necessary to re-examine matters not just from the perspective of immediate profits and indicators, but from a larger viewpoint encompassing the overall well-being and sustainability of society.</p>
        <p>To solve the problems of our complex modern society, rather than dreaming up entirely new rules, it is crucial to first <u>face "reality"</u> as it is here and now. We must calmly analyze how this complex system functions, why problems are arising, and identify their true nature. Then, by addressing the root causes of these problems and adjusting the system itself, we can take a more realistic and effective approach.</p>
        <p>What we arrived at after much trial and error was, in the end, the "<u>commonsense truth</u>" that "<strong>balance is crucial in all things</strong>"â€”a truth not particularly novel, yet one that modern society tends to overlook. Just as medicine can become poison if taken in excess, even the most excellent mechanisms or elements can become detrimental if they become ends in themselves and lack overall balance.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we propose to place this universal principle of "balance" at the core of our efforts to understand and improve social systems. As a symbol of this, we use the "scales" (or "libra"), which have represented fairness and equilibrium since ancient times. We present "<strong>Libra/Scales Capitalism (LSC)</strong>" as a foundational way of thinking to constantly restore and maintain a <u>dynamic balance</u> in addressing the various challenges of society as a whole, including the economic system.</p>
        <p>This principle is not limited to the economy alone but keeps broader society in mind. However, it takes the form of "Capitalism" because its origin lies in the economy, this is an issue of the <u>balance of capital</u>, and it is easier to grasp as a concrete improvement target. But this "-ism" itself is not confined to a specific economic system and can be applied to balance adjustment in all phenomena. What is important is not the "<strong>realization of the -ism</strong>" of LSC itself as the goal, but rather achieving "<strong>improvement of the current situation through the -ism</strong>" by using the LSC framework of thought. This <u>practicality and orientation towards real-world transformation</u> are the greatest reasons for Libra/Scales Capitalism's existence.</p>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> In East Asian classical thought, particularly relevant to the Japanese understanding from which LSC originates, the concept underpinning "economy" (<em>keizai</em>) is captured by the term <em>keikoku saimin</em>. This phrase literally means "to govern the country and save the people" or "to manage the world and aid the populace." It emphasizes a holistic approach where economic activity is intrinsically linked to wise governance, societal well-being, and the alleviation of suffering, rather than being solely focused on fiscal metrics or market mechanisms. This broader, more humanistic understanding informs LSC's perspective on the purpose of an economic system.</p>
