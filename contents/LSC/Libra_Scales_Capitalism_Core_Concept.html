       <div class="supplementary-note">
           <h3>A Note on the Fundamental Approach of LSC</h3>
           <p>Libra/Scales Capitalism (LSC) is not a specific religion or a fixed dogma. It is a thinking support system and an approach aimed at improving reality.</p>
           <p>To align with the direction of LSC, it is sufficient to understand each of the "Core Concept" principles presented here. The purpose of LSC is not to absolutize this ideological system itself, but rather to function as a tool for finding a better balance in the face of complex real-world challenges and promoting concrete improvements. Therefore, it can overlap with or be used in parallel with other ideological systems and practical methods.</p>
           <p>Each of the Core Concept principles listed here is also a "hypothesis of truth" at the current time and is not eternally unchangeable. They do not compel any individual or group to do anything, nor do they restrict thought.</p>

           <h4>Examples of Shared Understandings Derived from the Core Concept:</h4>
           <div class="example-section">
               <p>For instance, from the principle that all things are interconnected and that value is relative (except for life), the understanding is derived that "all constructive relationships should ultimately aim for a Win-Win (mutual benefit), and no other option is sustainable."</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the following stance in life can be said to resonate with the spirit of the Core Concept:</p>
               <blockquote>"Since no human being can live without causing some inconvenience to others, let us also forgive the inconveniences caused by others. Pay it forward. If you pass on the kindness received with a little extra, someday that kindness will help you. The world is, in a way, both vast and small, small and vast. Let's add interest to all acts of kindness."</blockquote>
               <p>These are merely examples of ways of thinking that can be derived from the Core Concept, and practitioners of LSC do not necessarily need to agree with all of them. What is important is the stance of understanding the core principles and attempting to apply them to solve real-world problems.</p>

       <h2>LSC Core Principles: Detailed Explanation</h2>

       <h3>1. The Preciousness of Abnormality</h3>
       <p><strong>Proposition: To be abnormal, its unique, once-in-a-lifetime brilliance, generates distinct value that surpasses conventional normalcy.</strong></p>
       <p>Generally, the word "abnormal" tends to carry negative connotations, such as deviating from a standard or being in an undesirable state. However, the principle of "The Preciousness of Abnormality" in Libra/Scales Capitalism (LSC) fundamentally questions this conventional valuation. The "abnormality" referred to here does not simply mean deviation or chaos, but rather emphasizes aspects such as <strong>irreproducible uniqueness, the potential to disrupt existing equilibriums, and the source of new value creation</strong>.</p>
       <p>Paradoxical perspectives like "Death is normal, life is abnormal," "Sleep is normal, wakefulness is abnormal," or "War is normal, peace is abnormal" help in understanding this principle. What we consider "normal" might merely be maintained by custom or inertia, and true dynamism or the brilliance of life might manifest in moments of deviation from this "normalcy"—that is, in moments of "abnormality."</p>
       <p>The reason this principle is placed at the core of LSC is that it affirms the <strong>driving forces of change and creation</strong>. Abnormal events or entities, due to their uniqueness, are difficult to replicate and may possess value immeasurable by existing frameworks. This could be the discovery of a niche market, a new form of artistic expression, or an innovative idea in social systems. A stable "normal" state can sometimes lead to stagnation and rigidity. The occurrence of "abnormality" can serve as a warning against existing systems and values, acting as a catalyst for self-renewal and evolution. A balanced society, as envisioned by LSC, is not one where everything conforms to a uniform "norm," but rather one where individual characteristics and talents, even those that might seem "abnormal," are respected and utilized. This leads to the acceptance of diverse business models in the economy, respect for minority perspectives in culture, and the affirmation of unique ways of life.</p>
       <p>In LSC, the recognition of "The Preciousness of Abnormality" is a fundamental stance for society and the economy to remain dynamic, continuously incorporating new value and evolving. It encourages embracing new challenges without fear of risk, learning from failures, and looking beyond standardized efficiency to appreciate uniqueness and creativity that might seem inefficient at first glance. Understanding this principle means recognizing the importance of maintaining an open posture towards new possibilities, unconstrained by fixed ideas.</p>

       <h3>2. Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form (Nothing is Everything; Everything is Nothing)</h3>
       <p><strong>Proposition: All that exists lacks a fixed essence; within nothingness lies the paradoxical truth of infinite potential.</strong></p>
       <p>This principle reinterprets the classic Eastern wisdom of "Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form" within the LSC context, attempting to capture its core meaning with the English expression "Nothing is Everything; Everything is Nothing." This offers a profound insight into the nature of existence—of the universe, society, and the individual—forming a basis for LSC's dynamic values and perception of reality.</p>
       <p><strong>Everything is Nothing:</strong> This is the understanding that all concrete forms we perceive in the world—phenomena, values, systems, or even individual identities—do not possess a fixed, unchanging substance or absolute value in themselves. They merely take on temporary forms and meanings under specific conditions of time, space, relationships, and prerequisites. As times change, values shift; as situations alter, meanings transform. Authorities once seen as absolute, or systems appearing unshakeable, will eventually change, disintegrate, and reveal their inherent "emptiness" (impermanence and relativity). This understanding liberates us from excessive attachment to existing structures and values, granting us the flexibility to embrace change without fear.</p>
       <p><strong>Nothing is Everything:</strong> Conversely, "emptiness" (Nothing) does not signify mere void or non-existence. Rather, it is like a boundless womb from which all forms and phenomena can arise, pregnant with infinite possibilities. It is precisely because "emptiness" is not fixed into any particular form that new creations can emerge and diverse values can manifest. Just as a glimmer of hope can appear in the depths of despair, or innovative ideas can spring from a "zero-base," "emptiness" is the wellspring of change and regeneration. LSC emphasizes recognizing the latent energy within this "emptiness" and channeling it into a dynamic process for real-world transformation.</p>
       <p>This principle is deeply intertwined with other core LSC tenets, such as why LSC is "dynamic," "does not adopt 'should-be' arguments," and posits that "all truth is conditional." The awareness that "Everything is Nothing" allows us to accept change as natural and highlights the danger of clinging to past successes or existing frameworks. LSC presupposes this impermanent reality, aiming to continuously update the system itself. The understanding that "Nothing is Everything" shows that even when the present seems daunting, new possibilities always lie dormant. LSC focuses on unleashing this creative potential for problem-solving and new value creation. By not idolizing specific values or systems and understanding their relativity and transience, we can free ourselves from ideological conflicts and rigid thinking. The principle of "Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form" teaches us that the "maintenance of balance" LSC aims for is not a static equilibrium but a dynamic process of constantly creating new balance amidst perpetual change and generation. It is wisdom for living flexibly and creatively while facing the complexity and uncertainty of reality.</p>

       <h3>3. Universalization of Relativity</h3>
       <p><strong>Proposition: All domains—economy, culture, society, life, etc.—operate within relative laws, with "Life" itself being the sole exception, positioned as an absolute value.</strong></p>
       <p>Albert Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized physics by overturning conventional notions of absolute time and space, showing their variability based on the observer's state. The "Universalization of Relativity" in Libra/Scales Capitalism (LSC) seeks to extend this revolutionary insight to all domains of human society, including economics, society, culture, and values.</p>
       <p><strong>The Relativity of Value:</strong> At the heart of LSC lies the recognition that (with the exception of Life) no absolute standard of value exists. The price of a product or service, the rightness or wrongness of an action, the superiority of a cultural norm—all these constantly fluctuate depending on the era, location, social group, and an individual's position or perspective. What once held value can become worthless, and vice versa. Understanding this "relativity of value" is the first step towards mutual recognition of diverse values and tolerance for different opinions and cultures. It also highlights the futility of imposing one's specific value standards on others, or the danger of regarding one's own values as absolute.</p>
       <p><strong>The Relativity of Laws and Rules:</strong> Economic systems, social institutions, and laws are also not absolute or immutable. They are created by humans to achieve specific objectives within particular historical and social contexts. As circumstances change, they should be re-evaluated and revised. LSC refrains from sanctifying any institution or ideology, instead consistently examining whether they function effectively in the current reality and contribute to a better balance, making corrections and updates as necessary.</p>
       <p><strong>"Life" as the Sole Exceptional Value:</strong> Within this universal relativity, LSC posits a single, exceptional value: "Life." "Life" here refers not only to biological survival but also encompasses individual dignity, the right to pursue happiness, and the intrinsic worth of all living beings. Precisely because values are relative, we tend to seek some absolute anchor. LSC places this anchor not in external authorities or material wealth, but in the dignity of all "Life," including our own. This "absoluteness of Life" serves as an ethical compass, directing LSC's ultimate societal goal: a balanced state where all Life can flourish.</p>
       <p>The "Universalization of Relativity" provides LSC with a foundational worldview for embracing the complexity and diversity of reality as it is, while simultaneously pursuing a "better balance" without losing sight of human values. The understanding that everything is relative endows LSC with high flexibility and adaptability to change. By comprehending different values, cultures, and ways of life as relative, it lays the groundwork for a society that respects true diversity and fosters coexistence. Positing "Life" as the sole exceptional value clearly defines an ethical guideline: to always prioritize humanity, its well-being, and the sustainability of Life in the design of economic activities and social systems.</p>

       <h3>4. The Existence of the Sole "Absent Scale"</h3>
       <p><strong>Proposition: Life is a singular series of choices, and no physical scale exists to accurately measure unquantifiable values (such as effort, ability, or happiness). Consequently, temporary satisfaction based on flawed metrics is destined to collapse—a recognition of reality.</strong></p>
       <p>This principle sharply addresses the inherent difficulty of the "choices" and "evaluations" we face daily, and the potential for error lurking within them. Despite its name, LSC presents the paradoxical awareness that "the scale is absent," prompting a deeper inquiry into what "true balance" LSC actually aims for.</p>
       <p><strong>The Irreversibility of Life and Choices:</strong> Our lives are shaped by a continuous series of choices, none of which can be undone. Decisions made based on the information, emotions, and values of the moment, for better or worse, define our subsequent reality. While regret over past choices—"if only I had done this then"—is a common human experience, it is merely hindsight. Possessing perfect information and judgment at the moment of choice is impossible. This continuity and irreversibility of choices constitute the solemn reality of life.</p>
       <p><strong>The Proliferation of Unquantifiable Values:</strong> Many of the essential values that enrich our lives—human effort, talent, love, friendship, a sense of happiness, or the profound emotional impact from art—are extremely difficult to measure objectively or compare simply. Nevertheless, we often attempt to evaluate ourselves and others, and to establish hierarchies, based on visible, quantifiable indicators such as academic credentials, income, job titles, or the number of "likes" on social media. LSC warns that these indicators do not necessarily reflect intrinsic value.</p>
       <p><strong>The "Absent Scale" and "False Scales":</strong> No "physical scale" exists that can accurately measure intrinsic worth. Despite this, we tend to rely on "false scales" (flawed evaluative criteria) presented by societal conventions, temporary trends, or authorities. These "false scales" might offer fleeting satisfaction or a sense of superiority, but their foundations are fragile and easily crumble with changing circumstances or when true nature is revealed. As a result, any happiness built upon them is also lost, and we are once again confronted with the question: "By what standards should we judge value?"</p>
       <p>This principle suggests the importance of facing the complexity and depth of life without resorting to facile evaluations or comparisons, and of continually questioning and refining our own values. Recognizing the limits of human judgment and the absence of objective evaluative scales is a starting point for LSC to face reality directly and constantly self-verify. It encourages a shift in focus from quantifiable metrics and superficial success towards more essential values (such as personal growth, contribution to others, and spiritual fulfillment), resonating with LSC's tenet of "Life" as the absolute value. Acknowledging the "absent scale," we must still make judgments and choose actions. LSC, instead of relying on a fixed scale, emphasizes a process of subjectively creating and updating a "meaningful scale" (a better-than-not standard of judgment, a more optimal balance) in each specific situation and context through dialogue and trial-and-error. This can be seen as a cautionary note for cultivating the true sense of balance—one that is not superficial—that LSC aims for.</p>

       <h3>5. Temporal Relativity of Justice</h3>
       <p><strong>Proposition: Time is ever-flowing; justice in the present is judged by the values of that specific time, and the standards of the past and future will differ. We must not mistake present justice as perpetual, a warning against creating chains of condemnation.</strong></p>
       <p>This principle urges a stark recognition that the concept of "justice" in society is not absolute or unchanging, but rather relative, constantly shifting within the irreversible flow of time. LSC considers understanding this "Temporal Relativity of Justice" essential for avoiding the repetition of past mistakes and for building a more tolerant, future-oriented society.</p>
       <p><strong>"Today's" Justice is Only for "Today":</strong> The values and norms (justice) we currently believe to be "right" are formed under the complex influence of various factors specific to this moment: the social situation, the level of science and technology, and public consciousness. Therefore, their legitimacy is valid only within this particular context of "here and now." While LSC acknowledges the importance of judging current issues and acting based on this "present justice," it cautions against the illusion that this justice possesses universal validity.</p>
       <p><strong>Chains of Condemnation Towards the Past:</strong> Unilaterally condemning past events or figures based on contemporary values often becomes an unproductive act that disregards complex historical contexts. The past had its own "justice," and people lived within the constraints of their era. Similarly, what we now believe to be "absolute justice" may well be criticized in the future—decades or centuries hence—as incomplete or biased. The admonition, "We must not make the mistake of believing that today's justice is eternal; that only perpetuates future condemnations," highlights the need to break these chains of judgment.</p>
       <p><strong>Flexibility Towards the Future:</strong> By not idolizing the "present" and instead viewing it merely as a "passing point," it becomes crucial to maintain flexibility towards new values and societal changes in the future. LSC aims for an evolving system that does not cling to a fixed "correctness" but constantly observes dynamic societal shifts and seeks a better balance for the future.</p>
       <p>The principle of "Temporal Relativity of Justice" indicates that the "dynamic maintenance of the scale" LSC aims for is not limited to mere economic balance but extends to the construction of a more long-term, sustainable social system that also considers the axis of time. It cultivates a humble attitude of learning from past mistakes while avoiding facile condemnation and striving to understand historical context. It encourages a more tolerant approach to opinions and ways of life that differ from current values, considering the possibility that they may be evaluated differently in the future. It also carries a self-referential perspective that LSC itself should be reviewed and updated in response to future changes, thereby preventing LSC from becoming rigid and turning into a new "oppressive justice." When the "justice" of different eras or cultures collides, understanding their relativity enables a search for more constructive dialogue and reconciliation. This serves as a guideline for applying the lessons of the past to the future and living more wisely in the present.</p>

       <h3>6. Unconditional Affirmation of Existence and Gratitude</h3>
       <p><strong>Proposition: The reason a being is considered "Human" (in the full social and spiritual sense) is because, through long struggles with solitude and alienation, they require something that unconditionally affirms their existence and to which they can feel gratitude—be it a divine entity, a partner, or even a symbolic presence that is always there. All people share this fundamental realization and gratitude.</strong><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2_core">2</a></sup></p>
       <p>This principle illuminates the fundamental human need for affirmation and the importance of social connection. LSC posits that beyond discussions of economic systems and social structures, the inner stability and sense of well-being of each individual are indispensable foundations for a truly balanced society.</p>
       <p><strong>The Meaning of Being "Human":</strong> The assertion that a being becomes "Human" (in the fuller sense) because, to confront a hundred years of solitude, one needs an entity that "unconditionally and unrestrictedly affirms one's own being," suggests what "human beings," as social and spiritual entities, fundamentally require. When we face inevitable feelings of loneliness, alienation, or our own imperfections in life, we seek something that unshakeably affirms our intrinsic worth.</p>
       <p><strong>The Diverse Sources of Affirmation and Gratitude:</strong> That which provides this "unconditional affirmation" is not limited to a specific religious concept of a divine entity. It could be a trusted partner, family, a close friend, a long-cherished pet, or even a symbolic object like a teddy bear treasured since childhood. What matters more than the object itself is the ability to attain a fundamental realization of "I am kept alive," "I am a valuable being," and to feel gratitude for it. LSC acknowledges and respects the diversity of these sources of affirmation and gratitude.</p>
       <p><strong>A Universal Shared Sense:</strong> LSC views this "realization of being kept alive and the gratitude for it" not as something limited to specific cultures or individuals, but as a universal feeling common to all humanity, as indicated by the idea that "all 7 billion of us are like that." This shared understanding can serve as a foundation for mutual empathy and support, transcending differences in race, nationality, or creed.</p>
       <p><strong>"Your enemy is someone precious to another":</strong> This admonition serves as a crucial reminder that when we find ourselves in conflict with others, we must not forget that the other person is also an irreplaceable object of affirmation and gratitude for someone else. By imagining the connections and values that lie behind the "other," possibilities for understanding and dialogue emerge, rather than unilateral condemnation or judgment. This forms the basis for the Win-Win relationships that LSC aims to build.</p>
       <p>The principle of "Unconditional Affirmation of Existence and Gratitude" clearly shows that LSC is not merely a system pursuing efficiency or rationality, but a human-centric philosophy that deeply respects the human psyche and spiritual values, viewing them as sources of overall societal balance and harmony. LSC considers it a vital societal goal for individuals to possess self-affirmation and live with mental stability. The recognition that all people share a "gratitude for being kept alive" fosters empathy towards others and a sense of social solidarity. The perspective that even an "enemy" is precious to someone else can mitigate conflict and provide an impetus for building more harmonious relationships. It presents a value system where not only material affluence but also inner fulfillment and a spirit of gratitude lead to sustainable happiness.</p>

       <h3>7. All Truth is Conditional / Dependent on Prerequisites</h3>
       <p><strong>Proposition: No assertion or "truth" can exist without the specific context, assumptions, or perspectives (prerequisites) that allow it to hold true.</strong></p>
       <p>This principle serves as the epistemological foundation of Libra/Scales Capitalism (LSC), a cornerstone of utmost importance. It fundamentally questions the idea that absolute, universal "truth" exists independently as we seek to understand the world, make judgments, and choose actions. Instead, it promotes the recognition that everything considered "truth" is, in reality, dependent on a specific framework or background (prerequisites) for it to function as such.</p>
       <p><strong>Context Dependency:</strong> Whether a claim is correct or a law is applicable heavily depends on its context (historical, cultural, social, economic conditions, etc.). For example, the "truth" that a particular economic policy is effective can become entirely invalid if prerequisites such as a country's industrial structure, national character, or international environment change.</p>
       <p><strong>The Inevitability of Assumptions:</strong> Even scientific laws contain implicit or explicit assumptions in their descriptions and scope of application. For instance, while Newtonian physics is an extremely effective "truth" for explaining many everyday phenomena, under prerequisites such as speeds approaching the speed of light or in the quantum realm, different "truths" like relativity or quantum mechanics are required. Our thoughts and discussions are always built upon some form of assumption.</p>
       <p><strong>Diversity of Perspectives:</strong> Even for the same event, its interpretation and meaning can vary greatly depending on the observer's position, experience, and values (perspective). It is a common occurrence for something to be "truth" for one person but not for another. LSC acknowledges this diversity of perspectives and emphasizes dialogue and understanding between different viewpoints, rather than imposing a single "absolute truth."</p>
       <p>This principle ensures the intellectual integrity of LSC, allowing it to deeply understand the complexity and uncertainty of reality and, on that basis, approach problem-solving with humility and rationality. The awareness that "all truth is conditional" warns against the danger of idolizing specific dogmas or ideologies and blindly adhering to them. LSC itself, in accordance with this principle, does not regard itself as a fixed, "perfected truth" but positions itself as something to be constantly verified and updated by feedback from reality. This is the basis for LSC's stance of "not adopting 'should-be' arguments." The understanding that "truth" can change if prerequisites change gives LSC high flexibility and adaptability to societal and environmental shifts, supporting its characteristic as a "dynamic ideology" that constantly analyzes situations and seeks optimal solutions without being bound by fixed ideas. When differing opinions or claims conflict, clarifying the prerequisites upon which each "truth" is based enables constructive dialogue to find common understanding or compromise. It encourages a critical attitude towards all information and assertions, questioning, "Under what prerequisites does this hold true?" thereby preventing facile generalizations or misleading conclusions. It demands that LSC practitioners constantly question their own foundations and continue to learn.</p>

           <h4>Notes</h4>
           <p class="footnote" id="fn2_core"><sup>2</sup> The original Japanese text distinguishes between terms that can be translated to "a being as a biological entity" (like <em>Homo sapiens</em>) and "a Human being" (which carries the connotation of a "human being" in a fuller social, relational, and spiritual sense). LSC posits that this deeper sense of being "Human" is cultivated through the need for, and experience of, unconditional affirmation and connection, often in response to existential solitude.</p>
